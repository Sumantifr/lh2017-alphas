Above analysis was with no (or small uncertainties).  What are leading uncertainties?  Estimate.

\subsection{Perturbative Scale Variations}

	Understanding scales at which $\alpha_s$ is being probed (as a function of zcut and beta)
		3-jet / 2-jet probes TeV
		But jet shapes probe lower scale than scale of the jet (which scale)?

	Perturbative Scale Variation (NLL/NNLL)


\subsection{Nonperturbative Effects from Shape Function}

	Treat NP effects (shape function?)  	Do we need shape function (or just a cut value)?

	Need to think about $\Omega_0$ issue (is it a shape-function-like shift?  Or just parametrically correct?)


\subsection{Finite $z_{\rm cut}$ Corrections}

	Finite zcut effects.  resummation vs.  power corrections?

\subsection{Fixed-Order Corrections}

	Matching to fixed-order?
		Universality in resummation region...
		...but process-dependence in fixed order region
		Efficiency of matching using NLO, making grid is painful
		Get help from FOMC expert
		LO matching is tree-level, e.g. MadGraph, PDFs...
		Matching to Fixed Order (remove the region from the fit, or figure out efficient calculations strategy.)

	Does peak give $\alpha_s$ information?
	
\subsection{Sensitivity to Initial State Effects }

	Parton Distribution Functions, 	Initial State Radiation, Underlying event.
