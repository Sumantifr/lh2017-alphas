	Look at e+e- case of jet shapes there (no quark fraction issue)

	Make a statement on e+e- (LEP) as well (can it do better than thrust?)
		Probes lower scales, so still interesting

	Limit our scope to e+e- is an option, though could just be statement, no study

	If we do e+e-, has to be compared to thrust
