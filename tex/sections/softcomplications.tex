Generic result of grooming is removing wide-angle soft radiation.  What impact does this have?

\subsection{Mitigating Nonperturbative Effects (e+e- and pp)}

Comparison to shape function in thrust.  Grooming gives different sensitivity to NP effects.

In standard thrust fits, whole distribution shifts from NP.  Degenerate with $\alpha_s$ shift, hard to disentangle.

Grooming pushes NP effects to separate region.  Separation of NP region, resummation region, fixed order regime (at high enough jet $p_T$).

\subsection{Process Independence at Hadron Colliders (pp)}

\subsection{Improved Detector Resolution (LHC)}

Cites to pileup study.
